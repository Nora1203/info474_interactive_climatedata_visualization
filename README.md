### User Interface

In this design, I used data from CLT, KNY, and KSEA to create a line graph visualization illustrating 
extreme temperature and average monthly precipitation since 1880. The x-axis represents the month, and 
the y-axis represents the temperature. The variables I have selected to analyze are record_max_temp, 
record_min_temp, and actual_precipitation. For the record maximum and minimum temperatures for these 
cities, I have created two line segments to show their distributions over the time. For precipitation, I chose 
to group it by month and calculate the average of monthly precipitation and present it’s value using the size 
of a circle. This visualization also has the following interactive features:
a. User can select the city they want to access from the drop down menu at the top
b. The check box at the top allows the user to hide the precipitation data.
c. User can hover over the precipitation circle to see the exact value.
